# text-to-bookmarks-html

#### what does this tool do?
it converts a text file with headings and links/titles to HTML format.

#### why do I need it?
if you ever had to change your default bookmark manager, you might find start.me is a great one. Problem is, their import system for getpocket app is broken.

#### any other uses?
Well, with this, just use any crawler to get your links in the format specified in that yt.txt file. Once done, run the program and they can be easily imported by Chrome/Firefox/Start.me(my requirement).

#### any plans to add features to it?
no
